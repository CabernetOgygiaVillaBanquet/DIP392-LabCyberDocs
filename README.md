# Problem Description: 
LabCyber requires an IT solution to streamline their documentation process, specifically for machine 
protocol documentation, and to seamlessly integrate with their Git repository.

# Why This Customer Was Chosen
LabCyber was chosen because they are actively engaged in cybersecurity research and have a clear 
need for an IT solution to streamline their documentation process, specifically for machine protocol 
documentation, and to seamlessly integrate with their Git repository. The team has agreed to 
provide continuous feedback during the development process.

# Estimated Development Time
The development of this application is confirmed to be feasible within 20-30 hours

# Details of the challenge to tackle
All FabLabs face an issue with documenting. Sharing is at the core of the FabLab philosophy, as they 
are places to grow skills as a community not just as individuals. But documenting takes time, formalism
or people dedicated to this task.

What could help (and this is just a hypothesis) is an app that would reduce the documentation time to 
its bare minimum and therefore reducing the FabManager input. It will redirect the content to its final 
documentation location here a github repo (part of it would be openly accessible part not)
The easiest ways to document could be photos, brief texts or vocals.
The types of documentation in Labs are either projets, machines or events related. 
What I have in mind is an app helping to architecture the documentation. It needs to be used on a phone 
easily (responsive design). The authentification process should be reduced to the bare minimum but 
security should not be neglected.

Once the content added it would be pushed for commit. An administrator would have to validate the 
addition
